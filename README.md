# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This repository contains a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game written in C. Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one wins or the game ends in a draw. The game features input validation and proper handling of taken positions. It's a great project for practicing basic C programming concepts.
